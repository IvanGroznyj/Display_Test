Code for my device

It's a library helped to develop any 2D video games for my device.
You can switch to virtual mode is running you code into console (don't need a MC)

"Compile_Mode.h" contains MODE. You need to define it like MC_MODE if you want compile into MC.
After that invoke:
$ make clean
$ make all
for MC
or:
$ make clean
$ make virtual
for virtual mode

Code for my device

It's a library helped to develop any 2D video games for my device.
You can switch to virtual mode is running you code into console (don't need a MC)

- "Compile_Mode.h" contains MODE. You need to define it like MC_MODE if you want compile into MC.
- After that for MC invoke: 
```sh
$ make clean
$ make all
```
or for virtual mode:
```sh
$ make clean
$ make virtual
```
